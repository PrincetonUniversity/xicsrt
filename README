A raytracing tool for X-Ray Imaging Crystal Spectrometers.

ToDo
----
  - Rather that throw away rays, update a mask.
    This will allow easier optics inspection and should not have any
    significant performance impact.

  - Create a superclass for all the optics.  Right now there is a
    lot of duplicated code. This will also allow the optimization
    of the FocusedExtendedSource to be applied to all sources.
