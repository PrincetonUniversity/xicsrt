================

There are a number of scientific x-ray raytracing codes available with
similarities to XICSRT. Each of these codes has a different set of goals,
strengths, and advantages.

SHADOW
------

SHADOW is perhaps the most well known scientific x-ray raytracing code and is
used extensively within the syncrotron compunity. SHADOW has been in continuous
development since 1982 and and has been thoroughly validated against experiment.

SHADOW is written in FORTRAN and released under the opensource MIT License. A
graphical user interface is available through the OASYS software suite and a
Python API is available for programmatic interaction.

A new version of SHADOW (SHADOW4) is currently under development in which the
code base is being completely rewritten in python.

Xrt (XRayTracer)
----------------

*xrt (XRayTracer) is a python software library for ray tracing and wave
propagation in x-ray regime. It is primarily meant for modeling synchrotron
sources, beamlines and beamline elements. Includes a GUI for creating a
beamline and interactively viewing it in 3D.*

XRT is written in Python and release under the opensource MIT License.

McXtrace
--------

McXtrace is an extension of McStas, a neutron raytracing code. *McStas is a
general tool for simulating neutron scattering instruments and experiments.
It is actively supported by DTU Physics, NBI KU, ESS, PSI and ILL.*

McXtrace/McStas is written in C and release under an opensource GPL 2.0 License.
