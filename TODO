General:

1. xics_rt_optics:  The way that the meshgrid currently interacts with the optic position and collect_rays is currently not as intended. The current code seems to work correctly, and is fine as a quick way to temporarily make some plots, but is not a good permanent solution.

Merge 2020-02-25:

1. All of the sightline stuff has been pulled out of xics_rt_plasmas. This needs to be reintegrated as a bundle filter.

2. xics_rt_plasms.RealPlasma has been removed.  This needs to be replaced by the base vmec class.
